SHORT STATEMENT OF THE CASE  1. This case is based on a massive fraudulent scheme devised in 2012 primarily by Defendant China Construction America, Inc. (“CCA”) to enrich itself at the expense and to the harm of Plaintiff BML Properties, Ltd. (“BML Properties”). BML Properties was the 100 percent owner of the voting shares of the development entity Baha Mar Ltd., which was developing the multi-billion dollar Baha Mar resort complex in Nassau Bahamas (the “Project”) until 2015, when CCA’s scheme set in motion three years earlier led to the collapse of the Project and the loss of BML Properties’ enormous investment while CCA and its Chinese affiliates profited.  2. Defendants’ massive fraud is one of the largest construction-based frauds in this hemisphere. The scheme was based on CCA’s efforts to falsely create the appearance that it was working toward an on-time and on-budget opening in December 2014 while knowingly and fraudulently concealing its real intent not to construct the Project on time and on budget and in the process extort more money than it earned and was due. Starting in 2012, as significant “out of the ground” construction began and the first floors above the foundations were being constructed, CCA knew that it would be unable to build the Project on time, on budget and in accordance with the plans and specs because, among other things, it did not have and would not commit to the Project the qualified workforce or sufficiently senior managers needed to meet its representations and obligations. CCA carried out its scheme by a series of knowingly and  intentionally false representations, acts of extortion, material failures to disclose, fraudulent acts  of concealment, outright sabotage, and lies to the Government of the Bahamas and the Project lender. CCA also knowingly and fraudulently intended, again undisclosed to BML Properties, to use the Project as a massive training exercise for its young and inexperienced cadre of workers, which doomed the Project to failure, and without regard to its agreements and representations, but all at BML Properties’ expense. CCA even lost a limited arbitration in August 2014 that exposed its understaffing of the Project and yet CCA continued to fraudulently misrepresent its existing workforce and its available resources and therefore its ability to achieve completion of the Project during that proceeding and thereafter. CCA intended BML Properties to rely on CCA’s misrepresentations that were made in furtherance of this scheme, and CCA intended that BML Properties rely on its mistaken belief regarding those facts CCA intended to  and did conceal or otherwise did not disclose.  3. As a result of Defendants’ acts and omissions, BML Properties lost its entire $845 million equity investment in the Project, incurred additional hundreds of millions in losses, and lost its right to all the future benefits of running a world-class multi-billion dollar resort with unparalleled amenities, including luxury hotel rooms and suites, golf, a massive pool and beach area, and the Caribbean’s largest luxury casino, on property that the Government of the Bahamas had originally suggested to Sarkis Izmirlian (an experienced real estate developer and the Chairman of Baha Mar Ltd.) that Baha Mar Ltd. acquire and redevelop.  4. New York jurisdiction, venue and choice of law was agreed to by Defendants in the relevant agreement and in their assumption of the obligations under that agreement.  5. CCA’s fraudulent scheme started in 2012 when CCA began slipping behind its schedule and it knew it was not “manning up” the Project. At that time, CCA began knowingly and  intentionally misrepresenting its present workforce as well as its ability to increase its workforce  in the future and knew without disclosing that it would not meet even its own schedules. CCA controlled and directed the conduct of the other Defendants over a three-year-long effort to extort more and more money from Baha Mar Ltd., and commit numerous acts of fraud to compel BML Properties to not exercise available remedies until it was too late to do anything meaningful to prevent the scheme from being completed.  6. CCA’s extortion manifested itself as follows: CCA did not want the Project to open before it had in hand 100% or as near to 100% as possible of its expected (even if unearned) payment for construction of the Project, regardless of what it or the other Defendants had agreed. CCA had to be in a position to force payment even on its fraudulent claims for additional costs or alleged delay given that (among other reasons):  a. CCA knew that there is no mechanics or materialman’s lien law in the Bahamas and, thus, no way for CCA to force Baha Mar Ltd. to pay after completion by foreclosing (or threatening to foreclose) on such liens;  b. CCA knew and had not disclosed that it would be using the Project (once it started substantially “coming out of the ground” in 2012) as a vast training facility contrary to its obligations and representations to supply skilled management and labor, inflicting on Baha Mar Ltd. and BML Properties the dire consequences of trial-and-error instruction for its managers and workers, indeed managers and workers CCA intended to use elsewhere in its expanding empire in North America and around the Caribbean and South America as a key second-tier subsidiary of the world’s largest publicly traded [SHA:601668] global contractor;  cs CCA knew that upon opening, BML Properties and Baha Mar Ltd. would have in  hand cash from hotel guests which after opening they could use to pursue CCA  for the myriad problems it had created and thus CCA had to force some resolution of its disputes with BML Properties and Baha Mar Ltd. before that opening, even if it required extortion to do so;  CCA knew that its appointees to the Board of Baha Mar Ltd. necessarily from 2012 onwards had to cover-up the truth about the status of every key element of the Project and its work on the Project in order to hide the consequences of its conduct, namely, that the Project would be undermanned, behind schedule and would miss opening into the Winter 2014 to Summer 2015 travel season without substantial acceleration at its own expense, something CCA was not willing to do; CCA knew later, reinforcing its decision to engage in this scheme, that it had incorporated so many material errors and defects into the Project (one of the many consequences of using untrained workers on a complex mega-project), that Baha Mar Ltd. would have tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars of defect remedy and related costs that it could back-charge to CCA diminishing what CCA might reap;  CCA knew that it had to use work-stoppages and work-slowdowns (in cooperation with its subcontractors, the bulk of which were also affiliates of CCA’s ultimate parent) to extort commercial settlements before Substantial Completion;  CCA knew later in the Project that it had caused and/or would cause well in excess of 242 days of delay, thereby exposing CCA to the contractual maximum amount of $50 million in liquidated damages (“LDs”) due Baha Mar Ltd. for such  delay, and thus the only way to avoid imposition of those damages was to compel  BML Properties (through fraudulent and extortionate means) to negotiate before any back-charge for the LDs would be taken (at the earliest in January 2015); After CCA lost an important dispute in 2014 before the Project Dispute Resolution Board (“DRB”) that found CCA in breach of its agreement to, among other things, adequately man-up the Project, CCA knew it could not afford to go back before that body and suffer yet another humiliating loss, faced with evidence of its own wrongdoing. Accordingly, CCA would make whatever agreement was necessary to avoid going back to the DRB including committing in the November 2014 Meeting Minutes, (described below) to a massive influx of workers to finish the resort by March 27, 2015, secretly knowing but not disclosing to BML Properties that it could not achieve that date. CCA’s admission of that “big lie” is found in a January 20, 2015, letter to CCA’s ultimate parent company, in which CCA confirmed its prior lies -- that it had not had enough workforce on site for many months, and that it would not meet its March 27, 2015, promised (albeit late) delivery of the Project without a massive influx of workers, who never arrived.  After it knew in 2012 that it could not complete the Project by December 31, 2014, CCA’s undisclosed intent was to squeeze every dime out of the loan (that it had helped “arrange” in 2010), and cast aside the interests of BML Properties, even though it had agreed to put the interests of BML Properties as an Investor  before its own as a contractor.  7. Accordingly, CCA’s entirely undisclosed and fraudulent intent in 2012 and thereafter included a plan to delay “opening” of the Project until it could negotiate its way out of the disputes it knew would arise and concerning which it believed it had material exposure.  8. CCA never intended to achieve the interim milestones and overall completion date(s) it represented after 2012 that it would achieve, over and over again as set forth below, and intended to hide for as long as it could its inability to achieve those milestones and its disregard for whether it could or could not achieve those milestones.  9. CCA’s fraudulent and malicious conduct misled BML Properties into actions BML Properties thought were needed to move toward real progress on the Project, and misled BML Properties into inaction as well, later forcing BML Properties to attempt to mitigate its damage after it was, at that juncture, too late to seek other remedies such as stop work orders, the “replacement” of CCA (with the Project lender’s consent), or other extreme remedies that would have at that point delayed opening well past December 2014 and March 2015, causing the resort to miss the entire 2014-2015 travel season and incur enormous losses. BML Properties relied on CCA to be truthful regarding its last hope to open in the 2014-2015 season, namely an agreement reached in November 2014 to accelerate CCA’s work in return for an additional $54 million, which unbeknownst to BML Properties CCA never intended to perform and knew when it signed that it could not and would not perform.  10. As the Project moved into late 2014 and early 2015, CCA as well undertook to sabotage forward progress of the work, intentionally damage and disable life-safety, security and electrical supply systems to try to compel BML Properties and Baha Mar Ltd. to accede to its demands on sham payment applications and on fraudulent “commercial claims,” stage labor walk-offs when  it was already critically delayed in delivering the Project, intentionally slow-down work at the  Project (a fact admitted by CCA’s executive at a meeting with the then Prime Minister of The Bahamas in April 2015), and divert equipment and executive and labor effort to its newly purchased competing project just a few miles from the front door of Baha Mar. Indeed, just 11 days before Baha Mar Ltd. was forced to file for bankruptcy protection due to CCA’s fraud and malicious conduct, CCA and the then-Government of the Bahamas signed an agreement (undisclosed until early 2017), based on what later press accounts deemed collusion between CCA and the Government, that ratified CCA’s movement of heavy equipment and Chinese laborers from the Project and to CCA’s newly acquired competing Hilton project while CCA was still under contract to finish Baha Mar.  11. Manifesting its complete disregard for the rule of law and its requirements under its contracts, CCA also bought gifts, the reimbursement for which it hid from BML Properties and Baha Mar Ltd. in CCA’s expenses as part of its “payment applications” sent to the Bank on the Project. CCA even resorted to stealing documents from the Project to accomplish its illicit goals and cover-up its previous reprehensible conduct.  12. Due to CCA’s conduct, BML Properties has incurred in excess of $2.25 billion in damages, and BML Properties sues herein for Defendants’ breaches of contract and frauds that caused that loss.  13. | While CCA itself also had an investment in the Project, namely certain preferred shares in Baha Mar Ltd., those shares were not purchased with cash but via an accounting book entry that “credited” CCA with certain to-be-performed “General Conditions” obligations most of which CCA never performed. Consequently, CCA’s preferred share holdings could not have been actually harmed by CCA’s scheme, and in any event it was CCA’s larger intent and in its  financial interest to establish this Project as a beachhead in the Caribbean, use its workers and  more senior staff to obtain and then construct other projects throughout the Americas and Caribbean and to be paid hundreds of millions of dollars for its purported work as the contractor and construction manager of the Project.  14. After China Construction America caused BML Properties’ profound loss, the Project is now operated by Chow Tai Fook Enterprises (CTFE), a Chinese company acquiring (via a secretive and suspect process) the Project from the Chinese lender, China Eximbank. China Eximbank requested that all files regarding this “merger” transaction be sealed from public access by the Court with jurisdiction over the transaction. As a part of this transaction, BML Properties is informed and believes that CCA received an enormous $145 million bailout characterized as a “remobilization fee” from China Eximbank even though the bulk of CCA’s equipment, materials, and workers remained in the Bahamas after 2015 for use on other projects. On December 7, 2017, CTFE publicly issued a press release in The Bahamas (apparently still in  redline draft), which stated in a section intended to be deleted from the release that “all  construction [by CCA] at Baha Mar has been performed above and beyond satisfactory levels,” revealing that CTFE is obviously uncomfortable with CCA’s level of performance. Suffice it to say, the only “winner” regarding the development of Baha Mar has been CCA, and CCA  inflicted horrendous losses on BML Properties in its fraudulent scheme to become that winner.  Il.
