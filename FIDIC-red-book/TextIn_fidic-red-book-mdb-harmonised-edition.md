## INTRODUCTION

A number of the Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) have for many years adopted the FIDIC Conditions of Contract for Construction as part of the Standard Bidding Documents which the MDBs require their borrowers or aid recipients to follow. In using the FIDIC Conditions it has been the regular practice of the MDBs to introduce additional Clauses in the Conditions of Particular Application (or "Particular Conditions") in order to amend provisions contained in the FIDIC General Conditions.These additional clauses in many cases have standard wording which has to be repeated whenever procurement documents are being prepared for a new project.Furthermore, the provisions in bid documents, including the additional clauses contained in the Particular Conditions, varied between the MDBs, and this created inefficiencies and uncertainties amongst the users of the documents, and increased the possibilities for disputes.

These problems were recognised bythe Heads of Procurement (HOPs) of the MDBs as significant, as were the benefits of standardisation. In response, the HOPs resolved to harmonise their bid documents on an international basis, by making use of the FIDIC General Conditions. For this purpose, the HOPs further resolved that there should be a modified form of the FIDIC Conditions of Contract for Construction, 1st Edition 1999, in which the General Conditions would contain the standard wording which previously has been incorporated by MDBs in the Particular Conditions.

FIDIC also recognised the major benefits to the users of the contracts of harmonisation and the inclusion in the General Conditions of the main common changes required by Particular Conditions in MDB contracts.Accordingly,the Federation was pleased to work with the HOPs to produce this MDB Harmonised Edition of the 1999 Conditions for MDB financed contracts.

It is believed that the modified, or harmonised document, will simplify use of the FIDIC Conditions of Contract not only for the MDBs and their borrowers, but also for oters involved with project procurement, such as consulting engineers, contractors and contract specialists working on MDB financed projects.

Use of the harmonised conditions should significantly reduce the number of additions and amendments to be included in the Particular Conditions. Nevertheless, most projects will have special requirements which will necessitate some specific changes.This harmonised document therefore contains provision for Particular Conditions, as has become the practice in other FIDIC documents. This MDB Harmonised Edition also includes sample forms for Contract Data (Particular Conditions - Part A),Securities, Bonds, Guarantees and Dispute Board agreements.

In general, this harmonised document follows earlier FIDIC risk sharing principles for the types of contract for which they were prepared. In most cases, the amendments which have been made to produce the MDB Harmonised Editon of the FIDIC General Conditions for Construction are those arising from the requirements of the MDBs,except for some minor changes of an editorial nature.

### However, in the case of the dispute provisions contained in Clauses 20.2 to 20.8 and in the associated Appendix, the opportunity has been taken to make other ©FIDIC 2005.MDB Harmonised Conditions of Contract for Construction

amendments which FIDIC considers an improvement on earlier wording in the Construction Contract, 1st Edition1999.

The insurance provisions given in Clause 18 of the document remain unchanged from the 1st Edition 1999, although some commentators have suggested an alternative approach to dealing with this specialised topic. In particular, Employers may wish to consider arranging for a dedicated single policy for the project which would cover all necessary insurances.

The advantage of such an approach is that it would avoid gaps or other misunderstandings in the insurances provided, including possible duplication of cover.If an Employer decides to arrange a single insurance policy, then a copy of that policy should be made available to tenderers during the tender period. FIDIC recommends that Employers should obtain, at an early stage of project procurement, expert advice on insurance matters.

The MDBs listed in the section "Participating Banks" have participated in the preparation of the MDB Harmonised Edition.It is understood that all of them will adopt this edition of the FIDIC document in their Standard Bidding Documents.

A draft of this MDB Harmonised Edition was circulated for comment to interested parties, prior to its finalization. All of the comments received were considered by FIDIC and some have been incorporated. Other comments will be reviewed again when in due course FIDIC produces a second edition of its Construction Contract.

The contribution of the FIDIC Contracts Committee to the preparation of this Harmonised Edition is acknowledged. The Contracts Committee comprises Christopher Wade (Chairman), Nael Bunni, Axel-Volkmar Jaegar, Philip Jenkinson and Michael Mortimer-Hawkins together with John B Bowcock as Special Advisor and Christopher R Seppala as Legal Adviser. It is noted that all were also involved, together with others, in the preparation of the 1999 Edition of the Conditions of Contract for Construction (refer to Acknowledgements inthat document).

FIDIC wishes to record it appreciation of the time and effort devoted by all of the above.

### Terms and Conditions of Use

The Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) started releasing in May 2005 Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs) for the procurement of works that conformed, "to the extent possible without contravening their procurement guidelines", to the model provided by the Master Procurement Document for Procurement of Works & User's Guide harmonised among the various MDBs and approved by the MDB Heads of Procurement and International Financial Institutions in October 2004.

The MDB harmonised Master Procurement Document for Procurement of Works &User's Guide incorporates General Conditions of a MDB Harmonised Edition of the FIDIC Conditions of Contract for Construction, which text has been agreed by FIDIC and various MDBs for inclusion in the Master Procurement Document for Procurement of Works & User's Guide.

FIDIC and the MDBs, collectively known as Participating Banks, have separately executed a licence agreement in several counterparts, each of which is deemed an original, but all of which together constitute one and the same agreement. This agreement regulates the terms and conditions of use of the MDB Harmonised General Conditions. It indicates that:

- the Participating Banks wish to allow their borrowers, including any entity implementing,on behalf of a borrower, an investment project financed by one or more of the Participating Banks ("Executing Agency"), to use the MDB Harmonised General Conditions free of any charges, even if bidders may be required, in some cases, to pay for the SBDs at cost;

- FIDIC and the Participating Banks have together negotiated the terms of a licence agreement so that any Participating Bank that chooses to have the terms and conditions of the licence agreement apply to it and its borrowers and Executing Agencies,shall execute a bilateral licence agreement with FIDIC on substantially the same terms and conditions, upon which execution it will become a Licensed Participating Bank.

By virtue of a licence agreement with a Participating Bank, FIDIC grants to the Bank a non-exclusive licence for the reproduction and translation of the MDB Harmonised General Conditions of Contract for Construction in the Bank's SBDs for Procurement of Works or equivalent document, and for the corresponding distribution to and reproduction and translation of the MDB Harmonised General Conditions by Executing Agencies, where such reproduction and translation is within the framework of projects financed in whole or in part by the Bank. Conditions for this licence are that:

- the MDB Harmonised General Conditions of Contract will be made available by FIDIC to the MDB in a reproducible electronic format;

-the MDB Harmonised General Conditions of Contract will become part of SBDs that the MDB will make available to Executing Agencies;

- FIDIC's copyright ownership shall be identified clearly in all copies of the MDB Harmonised General Conditions of Contract;

- The SBDs of the MDBs may include Particular Conditions for use in conjunction with the MDB Harmonised General Conditions to supplement or otherwise amend the MDB Harmonised General Conditions of Contract, and that these Particular Conditions may be developed and issued without the need to obtain the agreement of FIDIC.

FIDIC reviews periodically the contents of its Conditions of Contract for Construction.During the period of duration of the licence agreement with a Participating Bank, the MDB Harmonised General Conditions a) can only be modified and updated through prior agreement by the parties; b) FIDIC shall maintain communication with the Banks to assess the need for modification of the MDB Harmonised General Conditions in light of changes made by FIDIC to its Conditions of Contract for Construction,and also in light of other circumstances that may suggest a need for such modification;and c) FIDIC shall promptly incorporate all agreed modifications in new editions of the MDB Harmonised General Conditions that shall be provided by FIDIC to the Participating Banks.

The Engineer shall,within 28 days after receiving the Contractor's application:

(a)issue the Taking-Over Certificate to the Contractor,stating the date on which the Works or Section were completed in accordance with the Contract, except for any minor outstanding work and defects which will not substantially affect the use of the Works or Section for their intended purpose (either until or whilst this work is completed and these defects are remedied);or

(b)reject the application, giving reasons and specifying the work required to be done by the Contractor to enable the Taking-Over Certificate to be issued.The Contractor shall then complete this work before issuing a further notice under this Sub-Clause.

If the Engineer fails either to issue the Taking-Over Certificate or to reject the Contractor's application within the period of 28 days, and if the Works or Section (as the case may be) are substantially in accordance with the Contract, the Taking-Over Certificate shall be deemed to have been issued on the last day of that period.

(b)the Contractor shall cease to be liable for the care of such part as from this date,when responsibility shall pass to the Employer,and

(c)if requested by the Contractor, the Engineer shall issue a Taking-Over Certificate for this part.

After the Engineer has issued a Taking-Over Certificate for a part of the Works,the Contractor shall be given the earliest opportunity to take such steps as may be necessary to carry out any outstanding Tests on Completion. The Contractor shall carry out these Tests on Completion as soon as practicable before the expiry date of the relevant Defects Notification Period.

If the Contractor incurs Cost as a result of the Employer taking over and/or using a part of the Works, other than such use as is specified in the Contract or agreed by the Contractor, the Contractor shall (i) give notice to the Engineer and (ii) be entitled subject to Sub-Clause 20.1 [Contractor's Claims] to payment of any such Cost plus profit, which shall be included in the Contract Price.
