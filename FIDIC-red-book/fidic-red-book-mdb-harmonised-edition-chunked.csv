The Engineer may, at the sole discretion of the Employer, issue a Taking-Over
Certificate for any part of the Permanent Works.
The Employer shall not use any part of the Works (other than as a temporary measure
which is either specified in the Contract or agreed by both Parties) unless and until theEngineer has issued a Taking-Over Certificate for this part. However, if the Employerdoes use any part of the Works before the Taking-Over Certificate is issued:
(a) the part which is used shall be deemed to have been taken over as from the
date on which it is used,
(b) the Contractor shall cease to be liable for the care of such part as from this

(c) if requested by the Contractor, the Engineer shall issue a Taking-Over
Certificate for this part.
After the Engineer has issued a Taking-Over Certificate for a part of the Works, the
Contractor shall be given the earliest opportunity to take such steps as may benecessary to carry out any outstanding Tests on Completion. The Contractor shallcarry out these Tests on Completion as soon as practicable before the expiry date ofthe relevant Defects Notification Period.
If the Contractor incurs Cost as a result of the Employer taking over and/or using a

If the defect or damage cannot be remedied expeditiously on the Site and the
Employer gives consent, the Contractor may remove from the Site for the purposesof repair such items of Plant as are defective or damaged.

One copy of each statement will, if correct, or when agreed, be signed by the Engineer
and returned to the Contractor. The Contractor shall then submit priced statements ofthese resources to the Engineer, prior to their inclusion in the next Statement underSub-Clause 14.3 [ Application for Interim Payment Certificates ].
The Contract Price shall be adjusted to take account of any increase or decrease in
Cost resulting from a change in the Laws of the Country (including the introduction ofnew Laws and the repeal or modification of existing Laws) or in the judicial or officialgovernmental interpretation of such Laws, made after the Base Date, which affect theContractor in the performance of obligations under the Contract.
If the Contractor suffers (or will suffer) delay and/or incurs (or will incur) additional Cost
as a result of these changes in the Laws or in such interpretations, made after theBase Date, the Contractor shall give notice to the Engineer and shall be entitledsubject to Sub-Clause 20.1 [ Contractor’s Claims ] to:
(a) an extension of time for any such delay, if completion is or will be delayed,
under Sub-Clause 8.4 [ Extension of Time for Completion ], and
(b) payment of any such Cost, which shall be included in the Contract Price.
After receiving this notice, the Engineer shall proceed in accordance with Sub-Clause
## 3 5 [Determinations ] to agree or determine these matters.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Contractor shall not be entitled to such an
extension of time if the same shall already have been taken into account indetermining an extension and such Cost shall not be separately paid if the same shallalready have been taken into account in the indexing of any inputs to the table ofadjustment data in accordance with the provisions of Sub-Clause 13.8.
In this Sub-Clause, “table of adjustment data” means the completed table of
adjustment data for local and foreign currencies included in the Schedules. If there isno such table of adjustment data, this Sub-Clause shall not apply.
If this Sub-Clause applies, the amounts payable to the Contractor shall be adjusted
for rises or falls in the cost of labour, Goods and other inputs to the Works, by theaddition or deduction of the amounts determined by the form"
Contractor Payment Adjustments for Cost Changes,"If this Sub-Clause applies, the amounts payable to the Contractor shall be adjusted
for rises or falls in the cost of labour, Goods and other inputs to the Works, by theaddition or deduction of the amounts determined by the formulae prescribed in thisSub-Clause. To the extent that full compensation for any rise or fall in Costs is notcovered by the provisions of this or other Clauses, the Accepted Contract Amountshall be deemed to have included amounts to cover the contingency of other rises andfalls in costs.
The adjustment to be applied to the amount otherwise payable to the Contractor, as
valued in accordance with the appropriate Schedule and certified in PaymentCertificates, shall be determined from formulae for each of the currencies in which theContract Price is payable. No adjustment is to be applied to work valued on the basisof Cost or current prices. The formulae shall be of the following general type:

Adjustments for
Changes in Cost
“Pn” is the adjustment multiplier to be applied to the estimated contract value
in the relevant currency of the work carried out in period “n”, this period beinga month unless otherwise stated in the Contract Data;
“a” is a fixed coefficient, stated in the relevant table of adjustment data,
representing the non-adjustable portion in contractual payments;
“b”, “c”, “d”, … are coefficients representing the estimated proportion of each
cost element related to the execution of the Works, as stated in the relevanttable of adjustment data; such tabulated cost elements may be indicative ofresources such as labour, equipment and materials;
“Ln”, “En”, “Mn”, …  are the current cost indices or reference prices for period
“n”, expressed in the relevant currency of payment, each of which is applicableto the relevant tabulated cost element on the date 49 days prior to the last dayof the period (to which the particular Payment Certificate relates);  and
“Lo”, “Eo”, “Mo”, … are the base cost indices or reference prices, expressed
in the relevant currency of payment, each of which is applicable to the relevanttabulated cost element on the Base Date.
The cost indices or reference prices stated in the table of adjustment data shall be
used. If their source is in doubt, it shall be determined by the Engineer. For thispurpose, reference shall be made to the values of the indices at stated dates for thepurposes of clarification of the source; although"

used. If their source is in doubt, it shall be determined by the Engineer. For thispurpose, reference shall be made to the values of the indices at stated dates for thepurposes of clarification of the source; although these dates (and thus these values)may not correspond to the base cost indices.
In cases where the “currency of index” is not the relevant currency of payment, each
index shall be converted into the relevant currency of payment at the selling rate,established by the central bank of the Country, of this relevant currency on the abovedate for which the index is required to be applicable.
Until such time as each current cost index is available, the Engineer shall determine a
provisional index for the issue of Interim Payment Certificates. When a current costindex is available, the adjustment shall be recalculated accordingly.
If the Contractor fails to complete the Works within the Time for Completion,
adjustment of prices thereafter shall be made using either (i) each index or priceapplicable on the date 49 days prior to the expiry of the Time for Completion of theWorks, or (ii) the current index or price: whichever is more favourable to theEmployer.
The weightings (coefficients) for each of the factors of cost stated in the table(s) of
